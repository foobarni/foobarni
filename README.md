# Welcome to my GitHub profile,

#### the showcase of my software tinkering urges.
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am BarnabÃ¡s Darai.

I discovered my passion for Linux in 2017, when I was looking for OS alternatives for my older generation devices that found modern Windows resource-heavy.
I've been sticking with Arch Linux since 2019, after I managed to install it, and it's been the most stable distro for me.
Check out my configs in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/foobarni/dotfiles) repository.

ðŸŒ± I am currently interested in system administration, virtualization and DevOps duties, and am actively pursuing courses to broaden my knowledge and experience in these areas.

### ðŸ”­ Project plans for 2024:
- [ ] A tty-only custom installation to be used as:
  - a *fancier* interface on a headless server or,
  - an extensible bare-bone desktop configuration (a base install++).
- [ ] A custom GTK theme once I'm happy with my window manager configuration's look and behaviour.
- [ ] Launching a personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
