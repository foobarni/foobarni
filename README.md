# Hi! I'm @foobarni

I like tinkering with Linux systems, having Arch Linux installed on my main device.
You can check out my configs in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/foobarni/dotfiles) repository.

I am currently interested in server maintenance, virtualization, and DevOps duties. 
I wish to gain experience in usage of tools such as Apache, nginx, rsync, and others needed to host, maintain or migrate servers.

### Plans for 2024:
- Building a tty-only setup to be used as:
  - a *fancier* interface on a headless server or,
  - an extensible bare-bone desktop configuration (a base install++).
- A custom GTK theme once I'm happy with my window manager configuration's look and behaviour.
- Launching a personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
