# Welcome to my GitHub profile,

the showcase of my Linux tinkering urges.
Check out my configs in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/foobarni/dotfiles) repository.

I am currently interested in system administration, virtualization, and DevOps duties.

### Project plans for 2024:
- [ ] A tty-only custom installation to be used as:
  - a *fancier* interface on a headless server or,
  - an extensible bare-bone desktop configuration (a base install++).
- [ ] A custom GTK theme once I'm happy with my window manager configuration's look and behaviour.
- [ ] Launching a personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
